# La-cybersecurite-et-ses-impacts

## Audience
I presented to 12th-grade students specializing in Economics and Social Studies about the global impact of cybersecurity. Many students were unaware of how significant cybersecurity is in protecting businesses, governments, and personal data. 

## Purpose
The goal of my presentation was to demonstrate to 12th-grade students that cybersecurity is a crucial issue in todayâ€™s world. I began by explaining what cybersecurity is, as some of the students were unfamiliar with the term. I outlined the various types of cyberattacks, including phishing, malware, ransomware, and data breaches, to show them the different ways systems can be compromised. We also explored the wide-ranging impact of these attacks, from personal data theft to massive disruptions in businesses and governments. I provided practical tips for staying safe online, such as creating strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and being cautious with emails and links.

Additionally, I discussed major global cybersecurity incidents, like the rise of cyberwarfare, using the invasion of Ukraine as an example, and the famous Stuxnet virus, which affected Iran's nuclear program. These examples illustrated how cybersecurity threats can scale beyond individuals and businesses, becoming matters of national security.

By the end of the presentation, I was pleased to see that the students now recognized the importance of cybersecurity. Their awareness of the issue had significantly grown, and they left with a better understanding of how vital it is to protect not only themselves but also broader systems from cyber threats.
