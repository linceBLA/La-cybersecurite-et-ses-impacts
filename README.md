## Audience
I presented to **12th-grade students** specializing in Economics and Social Studies about the global impact of cybersecurity. Many students were unaware of how significant cybersecurity is in protecting businesses, governments, and personal data. 

## Purpose

In my presentation I covered the essentials of cybersecurity, its various threats, impacts, and best practices for protection. Understanding these aspects is crucial as cybersecurity plays an increasingly vital role in both personal and professional contexts.

***What is Cybersecurity?***

I began by explaining what cybersecurity entails and its significance. Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, whether within a company using frameworks like NIST or on an individual level. The field has been growing rapidly as the number and sophistication of cyber threats continue to increase year after year.

***Types of Cyberattacks***

I outlined the different types of cyberattacks, including cybercriminality, ransomware, phishing, DDoS attacks, defacement, and spying (e.g., Trojan horses). I also discussed terrorist attacks, such as sabotage, which highlight the severe consequences of cybersecurity breaches.

***Impacts of Cyberattacks - Cyberwarfare***

We explored the diverse impacts of cyberattacks, noting how they vary depending on the type of hacker, from script kiddies to advanced persistent threats (APTs). Examples included the Stuxnet virus's impact on Iran's nuclear program, the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton's email release, and the cyberattacks that contributed to the onset of the Ukraine conflict. These incidents underscore the growing importance of cyberwarfare on a global scale.

***Tips for Cybersecurity***

To help the students protect themselves, I provided practical tips on maintaining strong cybersecurity practices. This included using strong passwords, keeping software and systems updated, employing antivirus protection, and regularly backing up important data.


By the end of the presentation, I was pleased to see that the students now recognized the importance of cybersecurity. Their awareness of the issue had significantly grown, and they left with a better understanding of how vital it is to protect not only themselves but also broader systems from cyber threats.
